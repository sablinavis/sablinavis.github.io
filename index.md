        Support users in setting up and managing thesauri, resolving issues, and contributing to practical solutions for data quality challenges—both internally and for end users—by translating insights from monitoring into improvements for the underlying thesaurus infrastructure.  
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed a Jekyll-based website, PoolParty User Documentation, containing guides, FAQs, and in-depth information to help users become more self-sufficient. The site complies with open source guidelines and ensures users always have access to up-to-date documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created Python scripts to monitor data quality within the thesaurus system and set up an initial dashboard to surface issues and bottlenecks in the infrastructure. This provided early insights for exploring similar pipelines and identifying opportunities for improvement.

      <td>Informatie Analist <br><br> Dutch Digital Heritage Network</td>
      <td>
        At the Dutch Digital Heritage Network, I mapped the application architecture of various projects that implement linked open data on their websites and analyzed which components could be used within the NDE architecture. The project's main focus was to investigate how these components align with the Digital Heritage Reference Architecture (DERA) and support its further development.  

        <ul>
         <li>
         Investigating architectural components within the application architecture in detail, identifying recurring patterns, and analyzing what those patterns imply when translating the architecture to the Digital Heritage Reference Architecture (DERA).
         </li>
         <li>
         Linked Open Data Tools: collaborating with the infrastructure team on the development of tools and services, such as HeritageFlix, and analyzing the Clariah Datastory environment for potential use within the network.
         </li>
         <li>
        Advising on modeling and using Linked Data. When needed, contributing to discussions on architecture and interfaces to support the effective implementation of Linked Open Data.

        At the Cultural Heritage Agency I worked within the Linked Data Information Services team on various projects involving different stakeholders. My role included: 
        <ul>
          <li>
           Implementation and support for the use of Linked Open Data: Assisted heritage organizations and subject-matter experts with implementing and using Linked Open Data (LOD). The goal was to demonstrate the value and benefits of LOD through DataStories and SPARQL-Leaflet visualizations. 
          </li>
          <li>
           LOD Modeling: Modeled data based on user needs using Schema.org, CIDOC-CRM, and a created a custom ontology to test the best fit. Developed an workflow for a funerary monuments dataset for data cleaning and modeled it using CEOX, including links to RKD and Wikidata where possible.
          </li>
          <li>
           Designed and implemented a Python-based data transformation and ingestion workflow to map CSV source data to a custom schema, enabling structured batch import into the RCE knowledge base.

        At the Custodial Institutions Agency (DJI), I worked on analyzing and monitoring the capacity of prisons and immigration detention centers. My key responsibilities included:  

        <ul>
         <li>
         Capacity Analysis and Monitoring: Performed daily analysis and monitoring of capacity within prisons and immigration detention centers. Refactored existing ETL processes in R to make them more robust against changes in data sources, improving the reliability and efficiency of monitoring workflows.
         </li>
         <li>
         Development of Time Series Models: Applied time series models (ARIMA/ARIMAX) to forecast leave balances, enabling the identification of potential bottlenecks (“backlogs”) in the system.
         </li>
         <li>
        Dashboard Development: Developed dashboards and conducted analyses on capacity data to provide insights into (1) leave balances over recent years and (2) prison system capacity, supporting data-driven decision-making.

        Thesis internship for the development and testing of a pH-sensitive ratiometric superfolder-pHluorin expressed in E.coli. The superfolder-pHluorin was created with the purpose to visualize, measure, and quantify its ratiometric properties in relation to change in pH and correlate its effect on microbial metabolism. <br><br>
        My work included bacterial cloning and transformation of mutant strains with pHluorin and superfolder pHluorin expressed in different cellular locations. Confirmation of mutants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analysis of DNA sequencing results. This was followed by the visualization of superfolder pHluorin expression with fluorescence microscopy; the construction of a calibration curve with a fluorometer; making ratiometric measures and calculations from fluorescence microscopy images and performing data analysis on the raw data with R, SPSS and GraphPad Prism.
